# Learning JavaScript

**IMPORTANT**: Until new advise this will be more a collection of notes than a structured breviary.

In 2018, the CTO of the company I was working for, entrusted me with the task of moving from unorganized JS to a JS MVC-ish implementation with React. For this purpose I created a repository to highlight some concepts and summarize the framework. It worked well (well enough), however, I found myself constantly going back and forth between React and JavaScript, something that polluted other training materials like Node (environment), Express (library), Vue (framework)... All these tutorials shared something in common: the language, JavaScript.

Looking back, I see several repetitions that are not strictly related to the topic of some of those essays, but you definitely need to understand them before moving on. Someday I will make time to do a cleanup, but erstwhile, I need to consolidate all that knowledge in one place. This is learning JavaScript.
